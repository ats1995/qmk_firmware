# Planck layout for Norweagian keyboard layout

Core design choices:

- Specifically for the Norweagian layout (probably also works well for other Nordic layouts)
- Numbers and special characters as intuitive as can be
- Thumb shift
- Home row focused
- Vim style navigation
- ... all while still usable for some games
